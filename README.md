# HecaTomb

The original HecaTomb I &amp; II in QBasic, which I developed when I was 16, in sweet sweet 16 colors...

## How to play

- Install [dosbox](http://dosbox.com), crank that sh\*t up to 15,000 cycles.
- Start the game:

  ```bash
  cd SRC
  heca2.exe
  ```

## Level Editor

`HecaEdi2.exe` is a full-blown editor, yay! Save w/ a number, load it up using "Play Own Level".

## Graphics Editor

Since I was too green behind the ears to understand how to read binary `*.BMP` files, I went and created my own EOL-separated hard-disk-hogging `*.PHG` graphics format (aka: "PhilBYGraphics". Yes.). Then -- of course -- I also needed to build an editor to draw them...! One day, I'll drop some instructions for `LrgEdit.exe` here...

## There be dragons

For those brave enough to peek at the source-code, I've created a quick (non-exhaustive) [SublimeText syntax for QBasic](https://github.com/nemoDreamer/sublime-syntax-qbasic). Knock yourself out.

## TODO

- [x] Standardize filenames to Title-case.
- [x] Make sure EOLs don't bork.
- [x] Take some sweet screenshots.
- [ ] Let it sit a while.
- [ ] Finally use sub-folders for levels, graphics, etc...!
